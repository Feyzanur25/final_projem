Project Details
This project is a decentralized payment gateway built on the Stellar blockchain. It allows users to securely and efficiently send payments using Stellar's native assets. By leveraging the Stellar network, we aim to provide faster, cheaper, and more reliable cross-border payments. The system includes payment transactions, memos, and error-handling mechanisms for a seamless user experience.

Vision
The vision of this project is to revolutionize global payments, making cross-border transactions as easy as sending a message. By utilizing Stellarâ€™s secure and scalable infrastructure, the project aims to create a platform that enables users to manage and transfer funds with low transaction fees and instant processing times. Our goal is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, driving financial inclusion.

Development Plan

Smart Contract Development:

Define payment logic using Stellar SDK.
Include memo for transaction information.
Set error-handling mechanisms for unsuccessful transactions.

Front-end Development:

Build a user interface for users to input payment details (recipient, amount, memo).
Integrate the backend Stellar payment logic with the front-end.
Testing & Debugging:

Test with Stellar testnet accounts for successful payments.
Fix any errors or bugs encountered during testing.

Deployment:

Deploy the project to Stellar's live network.
