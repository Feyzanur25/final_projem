#Project Details
This project is a decentralized payment gateway built on the Stellar blockchain. It allows users to securely and efficiently send payments using Stellar's native assets. By leveraging the Stellar network, we aim to provide faster, cheaper, and more reliable cross-border payments. The system includes payment transactions, memos, and error-handling mechanisms for a seamless user experience.

#Vision
The vision of this project is to revolutionize global payments, making cross-border transactions as easy as sending a message. By utilizing Stellarâ€™s secure and scalable infrastructure, the project aims to create a platform that enables users to manage and transfer funds with low transaction fees and instant processing times. Our goal is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, driving financial inclusion.

#Development Plan

Smart Contract Development:

Define payment logic using Stellar SDK.
Include memo for transaction information.
Set error-handling mechanisms for unsuccessful transactions.

#Front-end Development:

Build a user interface for users to input payment details (recipient, amount, memo).
Integrate the backend Stellar payment logic with the front-end.
Testing & Debugging:

Test with Stellar testnet accounts for successful payments.
Fix any errors or bugs encountered during testing.

#Deployment:

Deploy the project to Stellar's live network.

This project is a payment transaction system built using the Stellar SDK in Rust. It allows users to send payments from one Stellar account to another, including a customizable memo. The system interacts with the Stellar testnet through Horizon API.

#Features:

Send payments between Stellar accounts on the testnet.
Transaction includes a memo (optional).
Utilizes the Stellar SDK for Rust.
Asynchronous transaction execution using tokio.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Rust (version >= 1.56)
Cargo (Rust's package manager)
Tokio for async support
Internet access to connect to the Stellar testnet Horizon
Project Setup
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stellar-payment-rust.git
cd stellar-payment-rust

#Set up the environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

makefile
Kodu kopyala
FROM_SECRET=SXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TO_ADDRESS=GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
These represent the secret key of the sender account and the public key of the recipient account, respectively.

#Install dependencies:

cargo build

Run the project:

cargo run
How It Works
The program fetches account details (e.g., sequence number) of the sender from the Stellar Horizon API.
It builds a payment transaction with the specified amount and memo.
The transaction is signed and submitted to the Stellar testnet.
If the transaction is successful, a success message is printed; otherwise, an error message is returned.
Configuration
You can modify the PaymentRequest structure to customize the transaction details like amount, from, to, and memo.
Ensure that the sender account has sufficient funds and is correctly configured on the Stellar testnet.
